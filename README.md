# another nothing

You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
```
bundle
yarn
yarn start
```

- mobile is not supported
- most likely will fail
- messy code
- no i18n
- poor a11y
- doesn't support old browsers(?)
- tested only using firefox, and sometimes chromium

if you want a better experience, use [HmmOS](https://electogenius.github.io/HmmOS) instead (you just need a modern browser!)

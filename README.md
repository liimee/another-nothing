# another nothing

You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)  
... and some other stuff probably  
```
bundle
yarn
yarn start
```

- mobile is not supported
- most likely will fail
- messy code
- no i18n

- [![When not used over HTTP/2, SSE suffers from a limitation to the maximum number of open connections, which can be specially painful when opening various tabs as the limit is per browser and set to a very low number (6). The issue has been marked as "Won't fix" in Chrome and Firefox. This limit is per browser + domain, so that means that you can open 6 SSE connections across all of the tabs to www.example1.com and another 6 SSE connections to www.example2.com. (from Stackoverflow). When using HTTP/2, the maximum number of simultaneous HTTP streams is negotiated between the server and the client (defaults to 100).](https://i.postimg.cc/8ck2p690/image.png)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource)

if you want a better experience, use [HmmOS](https://electogenius.github.io/HmmOS) instead (you just need a modern browser!)
